//lecture 8

console.log("2" > 1) //yeah coz js converts string to number 

console.log(null > 0)
console.log(null == 0)
console.log(null >= 0)
//so here we learn that == and other operators work differently 

// === aka strict check checks the value but also datatype
console.log("2" === 2)


//** all such conversions are avoided
